# Project Charter: Global Trends in Nuclear Power
### Project Title
Global Trends in Nuclear Power: An Exploratory Data Analysis

---

### Project Purpose and Justification
The global landscape of energy production is rapidly evolving, with nuclear energy emerging as a critical contender due to its efficiency, low carbon footprint, and advancing safety measures. However, public perception of nuclear energy remains hindered by historical accidents and media portrayal. This project aims to use data science to explore the current state of nuclear energy worldwide, highlight its benefits, and provide actionable insights to persuade the public and policymakers of its viability as a primary energy source.

By leveraging exploratory data analysis (EDA), this project seeks to:

- Gain insights into global nuclear power trends.
- Evaluate the benefits of nuclear energy compared to other energy sources.
- Address common misconceptions about nuclear energy, including waste and safety concerns.
- Provide a data-driven narrative to support the broader adoption of nuclear energy.

### Stakeholders
* Primary Stakeholders
    * __The Public__: To provide accurate and transparent information to address concerns and misconceptions.
    * __Government Officials and Policymakers__: To offer insights that may influence energy and investment in nuclear infrastructure.
* Secondary Stakeholders
    * Researchers and educators in energy and environmental sciences.
    * Private sector companies exploring sustainable energy solutions.

### Project Scope
__In-Scope__:
* Collect and analyze publicly available global nuclear energy data.
* Compare nuclear energy metrics (e.g., efficiency, safety, waste output) against other energy sources.
* Create visualizations (graphs, maps, and reports) to present findings.
* Develop actionable insights and recommendations.
__Out-of_Scope__:
* Predictive modeling or forecasting of nuclear energy trends.
* Development of interactive tools or applications.
* Analysis of political or economic policies beyond data availability.

### Objectives and Deliverables
__Objectives__
1. Conduct as comprehensive exploratory data analysis fo global nuclear energy trends.
2. Visualize key findings to make them accessible and understandable to stakeholders.
3. Publish a detailed report highlighting insights, conclusions, and recommendations.
__Deliverables__
1. __Final Report__: A well-documented EDA report inj PDF format, including charts, graphs, and written analysis.
2. __Visualizations__: Static images or a visualization dashboard (e.g., PowerPoint, Tableau, or Matplotlib charts).
3. __Presentation__: A summary presentation outlining the project's purpose, findings, and implications.
