# Global Trends in Nuclear Power  
An exploratory data analysis (EDA) of global trends in nuclear power.

## **Introduction**  
Nuclear energy has long been a topic of controversy and innovation. From the catastrophic accident at Chernobyl in 1986 to the more recent Fukushima disaster in 2011, nuclear power has faced significant public skepticism. Despite this, advancements in technology and safety have transformed nuclear power into one of the safest and most efficient sources of clean energy available today.  

With the rising need for stable, renewable energy sources, nuclear power stands out due to its high energy output and low carbon footprintâ€”surpassing even hydropower, wind, and solar. Public perception, however, remains a barrier, often influenced by misconceptions about safety and waste management.  


## **Background**  
The initial dangers of nuclear energy have been mitigated by decades of technological advancements and stricter policies. Today, nuclear power is the second safest energy source, following solar energy, and it produces less waste than any other form of energy. In contrast to media portrayals, nuclear waste is carefully managed and often recycled.  

Countries like China are leading the way in adopting nuclear power, heavily investing in new plants. Meanwhile, tech giants like Microsoft have begun leveraging nuclear energy to power their infrastructure, such as repurposing the Three Mile Island plant for data center operations.  


## **Project Purpose**  
This project aims to analyze global trends in nuclear energy adoption and its growing acceptance in modern society. By exploring data from countries, industries, and organizations, we seek to answer key questions:  
- How has public and policy support for nuclear power evolved over time?  
- Which countries and sectors are leading the adoption of nuclear energy?  
- What insights can be derived to inform energy policy and private-sector strategies?  

The findings may reveal whether nuclear energy is poised to become a cornerstone of global energy policy, potentially shaping a future dominated by renewable resources.

## **Data and Methods**  
- **Datasets**: Data will be sourced from organizations such as the International Energy Agency (IEA), Our World in Data, and government reports.  
- **Tools and Libraries**: Python will be used for data analysis, with libraries like pandas for data manipulation and matplotlib/seaborn for visualization.  
- **Methods**:  
  - Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and patterns.  
  - Hypothesis testing to validate key assumptions about nuclear energy adoption.  
  - Comparative analysis across countries and industries.  


## **Next Steps**  
1. Conduct data cleaning and preprocessing.  
2. Perform exploratory visualizations to identify significant trends.  
3. Develop hypotheses based on initial findings.  
4. Validate hypotheses with statistical analysis.  
5. Document findings in a research report.  


## **Conclusion**  
Nuclear power is at a critical juncture, where public perception, policy, and technological innovation intersect. This project seeks to illuminate the true state of nuclear energy in the modern world and its potential to redefine global energy strategies.
